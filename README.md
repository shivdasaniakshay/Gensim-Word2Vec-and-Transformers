# Gensim-Word2Vec-and-Transformers
For disaster detection, a kaggle competition. This notebook was also unfinished since my computer cannot run a BERT model without taking 100 hours for 100 epochs, but it gives a good idea on how to detect disasters through text using a Bidirectional transformer combined with Word2Vec, giving a semi-decent accuracy of upwards 85% when run into submission file.
